# Lab 1 - Build a presentation from start to finish with Copilot in PowerPoint

Imagine you're a marketing manager at a company called Contoso. Your team is preparing for an important client meeting where you need to present the company's strategy for a new Chai Tea product line to be sold in Latin America Your goal is to create a compelling presentation that highlights the product's features, benefits, and use cases, while ensuring it adheres to the company's branding standards. You've already developed a business plan for this product, and want to use that content when preparing for your meeting. You need to collaborate with your team and get the presentation reviewed by your manager before the meeting.

By the end of this Lab, you'll be able to create a new presentation, based on a Word document, insert an image, edit text, organize the presentation, incorporate corporate branding standards, and send the draft presentation to your manager for review using Copilot in PowerPoint.

### Sample file

Throughout this Lab, we'll craft prompts for Microsoft 365 Copilot that reference this file. You should have already uploaded it to OneDrive during the lab setup process, but if you need to download it again, you can do so here:

[Promotion Plan for Chai Tea in Latin America.docx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2269126)

#### Exercise 1 - Create a new presentation based on a Word document

1. Open PowerPoint using the browser at [powerpoint.new](https://powerpoint.new) and start a new presentation.

1. ON the top-left corner of the empty slide, select the **Copilot** icon > **Create new presentation**, then use Copilot to generate a draft presentation using the following prompt:

    +++Create a presentation about Contoso's Chai Tea based on+++

1. In the prompt dialog box, enter a forward slash (/) followed by the name of the file **(Promotion Plan for Chai Tea in Latin America.docx)**. If the file doesn't populate in the list (it takes some minutes to sync), click on the **upload** icon > **Attach cloud files** . Navigate to **My files** and select the document from your OneDrive folder.
   
1. Copilot displays a presentation outline showing the potential slides and bulleted points to be included on each slide. Review the suggested topic and select **Generate slides** to continue. Copilot generates slides and content for each. The presentation may display results in either the **Slide Sorter** or **Normal** view.

1. Click on **Send** (You can optionally select a Presentation Template before sending the prompt).

1. Copilot will start drafting the structure for the proposed presentation. You can add, remove or reorder the proposed topics. You can optionally also select from **Image Settings** the images Copilot will use to create the slides.

1. Click on **Generate Slides**. Once the presenation is proposed click on **Keep it**.


#### Exercise 2 - Ask Copilot to help you create an extra slide

Because this presentation will be about Chai tea, lets include a slide about the history of Chai Tea. 

1. Let's first change the view in PowerPoint, if necessary. Select **View -> Normal**.

1. Return to the **Home** ribbon view.

1. Open the Copilot pane and enter the following prompt:

     +++Can you find the history about  Chai Tea?+++

1. Copilot responds with a great summary about the history of Chai Tea found on public web sources. 

     Copilot Chat is great for asking questions, summarizing or research (Web/Work) , but it does not have the capability to edit/shape our presentation. 

1. Lets ask Copilot to help as create a slide about the history of Chai Tea. Go to the first slide, click on the **Copilot** icon (top-left corner of any slide) and select **Add a slide**. Paste the following prompt:

   +++About the history of Chai Tea+++


    Now, you've got a great way to start the topic of your meeting. Let's look at the presentation now, and see how we can make it even more powerful.

#### Exercise 3 - Insert an image

While Copilot includes images as it creates slides , you may want to add or edit an image to be more specific to your presentation. You can ask Copilot to include an image from your approved corporate library, provided your administrator has set the appropriate configurations, or generate an image based on an idea you have.

1. Let's ask Copilot Chat to create a new image (made using Dall-e).

1. Enter the following prompt in the Copilot Chat pane:

    +++Create an image of a person sipping a warm cup of tea.+++

    > [!NOTE]
    > Feel free to experiment with your own prompt to generate an image  you think would work best for the presentation. The more details you provide, the better.

1. Copilot creates and displays an image that matches your request.

1. Copy and paste to replace the default image given in the Chai Tea history slide.

#### Exercise 4 - Edit the text

As you're reviewing the presentation, you may decide the text Copilot generated isn't right for you. Use Copilot to help you refine the text on your slides. For instance, you can type *Edit the text on this slide to make it more concise* or *Make this text more engaging for the reader* Let's see how:

1. Navigate to the slide containing the text you may want to edit.

1. Click on the text box you want to modify, clikc on the Copilot icon next to it (Rewrite, Pen icon), enter the following prompt (or use some of the quick actions proposed) :

    +++Edit this text to expand with more details +++

1. Copilot will modify the text box accordingly.

1. Review the suggestions provided by Copilot, then click on **Keep it**.

#### Exercise 5 - Organize the presentation

As you're reviewing the presentation, you may find that the topics in your presentation need to be more clearly identified. You can use Copilot in PowerPoint to inject this clarity.

1. In the Copilot Chat pane, enter the following prompt:

    +++Give me tips to improve my presentation, general and slide by slide+++

1. Copilot responds, providing general suggestions and individual ones for each slide. Remember Copilot Chat will not be able to edit the existing presentation, but you can use those tips to manually modify them (or use the Copilot features within the document used before).
